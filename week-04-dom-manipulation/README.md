# Week 4: JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Modify `index.html` and `script.js` to create an interactive mad libs game.

The game can be funny, serious, or realistic. You can tell an original story, or
you can recreate a scene from your favorite book, movie, or TV show. Get
creative!

Your `index.html` file should contain at least 5 input elements asking the user
for words, and the `script.js` file should contain JavaScript code that inserts
those words into the story.

Modifying the CSS is optional, so make sure your JavaScript works first.

Write your code one small piece at a time. Don't try to get all 5 words working
at once! Write the code for a single word, and then test that single word in
your browser. Check your browser's developer tools console for errors. When you
have a single word working, then move on to a second word. Repeat that process
until you have enough words to tell your story.
