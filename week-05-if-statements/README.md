# Week 5: If Statements

Modify `index.html` and `script.js` to create an interactive quiz.

The quiz can be funny, serious, or educational. You can ask questions about
yourself, or you can ask trivia questions about any topic you find interesting.

Your quiz should have at least 5 questions. The example already contains 2
questions, so I'd start by replacing those with your own.

When you're done, your code should have at least:

- 5 questions
- 5 if Statements
- 5 else if Statements
- 5 else statements

Modifying the CSS is optional, so make sure your JavaScript works first. You
might also consider incorporating different input types. The example already
includes a text input and a number input. What other kinds of input elements
are available?

Write your code one small piece at a time. Don't try to get all 5 questions
working at once! Write the code for a single question, and then test that single
question in your browser. Check your browser's developer tools console for
errors. When you have a single question working, then move on to a second
question. Repeat that process until you have at least 5 questions.
