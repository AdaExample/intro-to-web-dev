# Week 7: p5.js

This week, you'll use p5.js to create a sketch and practice your JavaScript.

You can create anything you want. I'd recommend starting with a static sketch,
and then adding animation or procedural generation to it.

Your final code should contain at least 5 of the following:

- Calling five different functions. See the p5.js reference for ideas:
  https://p5js.org/reference/
- Using the `width` and `height` variables to automatically scale your sketch
- Defining your own variables
- Using an if statement to conditionally trigger code
- Using a for loop to repeat code
- Storing multipl values in an array
- Caling the `random()` function to add randomness to your sketch
- Animating your sketch by changing a variable over time
- Responding to user input, like sketch when the user clicks
- Creating your own functions to organize your code

The p5.js library is one of the best ways to practice your JavaScript skills,
and that's the real goal this week, so try to focus on concepts that you've
struggled with.

Write your code one small piece at a time. Don't try to get everything working
at once! Write the code for drawing a single shape, and then test that single
shape in your browser. Check your browser's developer tools console for errors.
When you have a single shape working, then move on to another shape, or add
animation to your first shape. Repeat that process until you've got a working
sketch.
